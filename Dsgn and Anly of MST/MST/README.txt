MST : It's take userdefind input

->Introduction:-
-The program allows users to choose between Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms for finding the MST in a given graph. 
-It prompts users to input the number of vertices and edges along with their weights and then executes the selected algorithm. 
-For Prim's algorithm it's also ask for source node.
-After execution, it displays the selected edges and the cost of the minimum spanning tree with execution time.

->To Run the MST.java file:-
-Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
-Compile the Java file using the following command: javac MST.java
-Run the compiled program using the following command: java MST.java
-Give the input of vertices, edges, and weights
